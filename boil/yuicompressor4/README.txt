this folder contains the yahoo open-source javascript and css file compression.
the YUIhelper class was badly and quickly writen to recurse in directories
and copy the compressed js or css file
to the same direcotory (with the prefix at the beginning of the file name).
YUIHelper takes the file or directory of js or css files and the file prefix as arguments.
It will copy the compressed file to the same folder with the prefix appended to file name.
Also some code was added to YUICompressor to just copy file with prefix if compression gives error.
See the run-test.bat for testing or run-yuihelper.bat
