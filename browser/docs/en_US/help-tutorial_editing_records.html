                                              There are also a few options if 
												you want to add a record to your 
												table.<br>
												<br>
												Select the
												<a href="help-window_db_search_box.html">
												table</a> that you would like to 
												add a record to.<br>
												In the Number of Results, put 3 
												and hit Run Query.<br>
												You should now see the last 3 
												records from that table in the 
												spread-sheet.<br>
												In the spread-sheet 
												top menu,&nbsp; select [Data] -&gt; 
												[Add Row].<br>
												It will 
												add a blank row to the bottom of 
												your spread sheet.<br>
												Fill in the record fields on the 
												spread sheet and click upload 
												records.<br>
												<br>
												Keep in mind that adminApp 
												assumes that your database 
												tables have the first field in 
												your tables as a unique index 
												field, auto increment.<br>
												So if you were to delete the 
												auto-increment number (set it to 
												blank) on the spread-sheet, when 
												you upload the records, the 
												blank field is usually treated 
												as a new record with MySql.<br>
